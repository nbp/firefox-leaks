                    <p>This page will guide you on how to investigate a memory
                    issue seen in Firefox. You will be faced with buttons to
                    answer the various questions and the questions would be
                    refined based on your answers.</p>

                    <p>At any time, you can copy the address bar and resume this
                    investigation later on.</p>

                    <p>If you think Firefox leaks memory, we should first
                    analyze where the issue is coming from.</p>

                    <p>Firefox has a special page which is named <a href="about:memory">about:memory</a>.
                    This page is the first page to visit if you have any doubt
                    about the memory consumption of Firefox.</p>

                    <p>If you have not done so already open a new tab and type <a href="about:memory">about:memory</a> in
                    the address bar.</p>

                    <p>When you visit this page, you are faced with multiple
                    buttons, and your first goal is to identify what might
                    sounds abnormal.</p>

                    <p>To generate a report, click on the "measure" button under
                    the "Show memory reports" box on the top-left corner.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>An abnormal report would be a report where a process
                    consume an excessive amount of memory, and that this memory
                    seems excessive compared to the amount of content displayed
                    in the associated web page, or compared to the work
                    performed by the corresponding extensions.</p>

                    <p>The index of processes can be found on the right side of
                    the page. One should identify which process consumes an
                    excessive amount of memory by clicking on each process link,
                    and the first line named "explicit".</p>

                    a single process. An abnormal memory consumption would have
                    a process with an explicit value which is above 1 GB, or
                    twice higher than the other processes.</p>

                    to determine where the problem is.</p>

                    <p>The explicit section contains multiple sub-sections, such
                    as "heap-unclassified", "window-objects", "gfx". To identify
                    the biggest offender, fold everything, by clicking on the
                    sub-sections, and only expand the window-objects
                    sub-section.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/about-memory-explicit-detail.png"

                                  No other section is expanded.

                                  Each sub-section is annotated with some amount of memory
                                  as well as a percentage. In this image the sub-section
                                  top(https://www.mlb.com) has a percentage of 70 per

                    <p>What interest us now, is the name of the sub-section

                    help us use the proper tool to investigate the memory issue.</p>

                    in the abnormal process, under which sub-section do you see
                    the highest percentage located?</p>
